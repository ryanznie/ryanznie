### About Me

*I am a Data Scientist working on NLP / GenAI. Maybe a physicist in another life.*
- I am currently invested in state-of-the-art [LLM capabilities](https://github.com/ryanznie/AI-Journey)
- At times, I enjoy thinking about quant finance and various topics in philosophy
- For fun, I like playing basketball, cooking, and taking photography

I am currently exploring classical AI methods for [ARC-AGI](https://arcprize.org/arc) problems. More recently, I worked on [anomaly detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13789) for large physics experiments and competed in an [AI Math Olympiad](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ai-mathematical-olympiad-prize). I am also learning how to pre-write, write, and rewrite about [tech, humans vs AI](https://ryanznie.substack.com/).

Previously, I pursued my dream of being a [physicist](https://github.com/ryanznie/adlab-experiments) at BU's Advanced Physics Lab and led [BUAlpha](https://github.com/bualpha), a quantitative research team at Boston University.
