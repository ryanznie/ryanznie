### About Me

*I am a Data Scientist working on NLP / GenAI. Maybe a physicist in another life.*
- I am currently invested in state-of-the-art [LLM capabilities](https://github.com/ryanznie/AI-Journey)
- At times, I enjoy thinking about quant finance and various topics in philosophy
- For fun, I like playing basketball, cooking, and taking photographs. I also enjoy writing about humans and AI on my [blog](https://ryanznie.github.io/blog.html) here and there.

I am currently doing a deep dive into classical AI methods for [ARC-AGI](https://arcprize.org/arc) problems. Most recently, I worked on [anomaly detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13789) for large physics experiments and competed in an [AI Math Olympiad](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ai-mathematical-olympiad-prize) on Kaggle.

Some of my other projects include [face aging GANs](https://github.com/BU-Spark/ml-atfal-mafkoda-missing-children) for finding missing children and an [object detection prototype](https://github.com/ryanznie/eLab-Object-Classification) for identifying fruits in real time. I also previously ran [physics experiments](https://github.com/ryanznie/adlab-experiments) at BU Physics's Advanced Laboratory and led [BUAlpha](https://github.com/bualpha), a quantitative research team at Boston University.
