### About Me

- 4th year Undergrad @BostonU
- Physics + Stats major
- Interested in ML applications in physics, NLP, quant finance and philosophy of science
- Also enjoy playing basketball, biking, and taking photographs:)

I am currently working on [anomaly detection](https://github.com/AutoDQM/AutoDQM_ML) for CERN experiments, and a [CLI tool](https://github.com/ryanznie/quant-MC-methods) for predicting stock prices using Monte Carlo methods. Some of my recent projects include [face aging GANs](https://github.com/BU-Spark/ml-atfal-mafkoda-missing-children) for finding missing children, and planning for a [datathon](https://www.data4sustainability.com/). I also lead [BUAlpha](https://github.com/bualpha), a quantitative research team at Boston University.
