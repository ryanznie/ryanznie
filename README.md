### About Me

- Physics + Stats @BostonU, MS CS @GT
- Currently interested in ML applications in physics / finance and [LLM capabilities](https://github.com/ryanznie/AI-Journey)
- When I am not doing DS / ML, I enjoy thinking about quant finance and various topics in philosophy
- For fun, I like playing basketball, biking, and taking photographs:)

Recently, I worked on [anomaly detection](https://github.com/AutoDQM/AutoDQM_ML) for CERN experiments and a [stock price prediction tool](https://github.com/ryanznie/quant-MC-methods) using Monte Carlo methods.

Some of my other projects include [face aging GANs](https://github.com/BU-Spark/ml-atfal-mafkoda-missing-children) for finding missing children and an [object detection prototype](https://github.com/ryanznie/eLab-Object-Classification) for identifying fruits in real time. I also previously ran [physics experiments](https://github.com/ryanznie/adlab-experiments) at BU Physics's Advanced Laboratory and led [BUAlpha](https://github.com/bualpha), a quantitative research team at Boston University.
