### About Me

- 4th year Undergrad @BostonU
- Physics + Stats major
- Currently interested in ML applications in physics and [LLM capabilities](https://github.com/ryanznie/AI-Journey)
- When I am not doing Physics/DS/ML, I enjoy thinking about quant finance and various topics in philosophy
- For fun, I like playing basketball, biking, and taking photographs:)

I am currently working on [anomaly detection](https://github.com/AutoDQM/AutoDQM_ML) for CERN experiments and running [physics experiments](https://github.com/ryanznie/adlab-experiments) at BU Physics's Advanced Laboratory. My current side projects include a [CLI tool](https://github.com/ryanznie/quant-MC-methods) for predicting stock prices using Monte Carlo methods and [algotrading](https://github.com/ryanznie/options-order-book) using activities in the 0DTE options market. 

Some of my other recent projects include [face aging GANs](https://github.com/BU-Spark/ml-atfal-mafkoda-missing-children) for finding missing children, and an [object detection prototype](https://github.com/ryanznie/eLab-Object-Classification) for identifying fruits in real time. I also lead [BUAlpha](https://github.com/bualpha), a quantitative research team at Boston University.
